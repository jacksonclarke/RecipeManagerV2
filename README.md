# Overview

RecipeManager V2 is currently a simple recipe book program that allows users to create and save and load recipes. This 
project is still in the beginning stages of development. 
Currently, the program has uses the console for UI but this will be changed in a future update.

This is the second version of the app. The first version used Java, but we have decided to change course and use
native Kotlin for the Android development instead to improve functionality.

The purpose for developing RecipeManager is to create an online platform to support saving and sharing family recipes 
with loved ones, as well as to help prevent the loss of beloved family meals whose 
recipes have been lost to spilled coffee and hungry family dogs.
